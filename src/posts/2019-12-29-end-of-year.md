Do pessimists say "end of a year" while optimists say "beginning of a new year"? Does it even matter at all? What I know is that the change of year is just how we quantify events and progressions over our lifetime. Time is continuous and our lives are composed of small loops. Without the concept of years or dates, the continuity and routines would've messed with our memory. It's just easier to see time as chunks of years and track them based on just that. In reality, nothing changes instantly in one night except the number you put on dates.

When I was a kid, I used to celebrate new years with paper hats, paper trumpets, and sparklers. It was unusual to be allowed to stay up late, make noises, and play with fire, yet I could do that altogether during new year's eve. So, it was *fun* for me. I also remember that I was too weak to hold the sparklers in my hand because being hit by the sparks hurts. That's why my parents taught me to bend the wires and hang them upside down instead. In my defense, watching it from afar was still fun.

For the past few years, though, I didn't even bother to stay until midnight. I avoided going into public places to avoid the crowds, I also didn't look for any "special" thing to do. One exception was in the end of 2013. It was the first new year I experienced after graduation—I was alone in a new city, not spending the holiday with my family because I wasn't entitled to any paid leave, yet. That night, I just wandered alone in the street, bought 2 cans of beer for myself and enjoyed the free lightshow from a pedestrian crossing. Well, what can I say? The beer was cold and good.

My point here is, time is still *continuous*. It's good to put numbers on it—maybe for the reasons mentioned above—but time runs no matter what. It's good to plan a change for the better every year, but it's better to *actually* change for the better whenever you're ready. Run in your own pace, plan in your own time, and grow in your own direction. Happy new year.
