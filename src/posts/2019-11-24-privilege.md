I don't know how it all started, but it looks like the latest social media craze is to judge people and their achievements by their privileges. Well, it seems like the scope of the term itself is still a bit unclear. Some describe "privilege" as advantages you earned effortlessly from your family or environment, while others argue that past milestones, such as being accepted into a good university, also counts. What seems to be the consensus is that when one achieves something, one's privileges must have played a role.

Initially, I was against that statement because it sounds like an excuse. The way people say, **"he can because he has privileges,"** sounds like a way to imply, **"I can't because I don't have privileges."** People even said that some achievements are worthless because those are clearly due to the privileges. In my opinion, achievements are achievements. You don't get to dismiss them because you *think* they earned them easily. You haven't even heard their side of the story. I don't even care about who they are, what privileges they've been enjoying, or what struggles they've been through&mdash;I'm not here to take sides, anyway&mdash;I just think that we're in no position to belittle anyone's accomplishments.

This doesn't mean that I deny the impact of our circumstances; we're all going through varying scenarios and situations throughout our life. One's path is, with most certainty, different from others'&mdash;some being significantly easier or harder than average. You could have started at the bottom, with no access to facilities, no support system, and heavy burdens to carry. Or, you could have started near the top, where things are comfortable, with direct access to influential people, and abundant resources to spare. Surely the results would be different, but are you sure you could have done better when given the exact same condition?

My point is, **life is *not* fair**. We are born into different families, we live in different cities, we got into unexpected accidents, but we also bump into unique opportunities. Things are happening uncontrollably in-favor-of or against our will. And I don't think the goal is to have *true* equality in society (not possible even with communism?), **the goal is for us to be more empathic with others and for the systems to provide equal opportunities.** That way, our privilege will just be a property and less of a defining factor for growth.

To close this off, the inversed statement, **"I can't because I don't have privileges,"** isn't even [logically equivalent](https://www.varsitytutors.com/hotmath/hotmath_help/topics/converse-inverse-contrapositive) to the initial statement. That means it's even mathematically proven that not having privileges doesn't mean that you can't achieve things (haha). Just remember that we all have our battles. Let's fight ours and let others fight theirs&mdash;and enjoy their achievements, too.
