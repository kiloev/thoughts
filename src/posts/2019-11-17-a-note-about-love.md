Yesterday, we talked about love, relationships, and some other things that come with it. It wasn't all that serious; it was just an unplanned Friday night talk with a few friends in the office. As we were conversing, the topic of getting into relationships, staying in one, competing for love, even family's approval of one's partner, arose. Only now I realize that there are many ways to interpret and act on love, most likely due to the abstractness of "love", the practice of marriage as a necessity, and the lack of psychological education about relationships. Well, here's my two cents.

It is *very* easy to get caught on the fantasy of love where the flowers are blossoming, the birds are chirping, and there you are holding hands with your soulmate in your perfect life together. Our minds are so evil, it tends to blur the line between imagination and reality&mdash;it creates an image of how life *could* be because it's the easiest way to escape this boring and unexciting life you're in. Just knew her name? Sure, think of it as the prettiest name you've known your entire life. Saw her smiling to you? Nice, go think about that lovely date night where you'll both share your dreams. Talked with her once? Cool, let's think about what your kids will major in when they go to college. The point is, we have to see the pattern and regain control of our thoughts. **Don't just *dream* of love.**

Many people still think that attraction is a binary thing: (s)he likes me, (s)he likes me not. Spoiler alert: it's not and you knew it&mdash;your feelings toward people can shift ever so slightly, right? So, don't ask a yes-no question too soon. It's a weird culture we live in here, where "dating" (interest) is usually correlated with "relationship" (commitment). This is *not* the case in some other parts of the world. You don't have to be in a commitment to show interest to someone. We're allowed to talk to anyone, understand them, find common interests, see whether the personalities match, compare personal values, even check each other's political views. Getting to know each other is a journey, and you don't need statuses to start this journey. **Don't *gamble* for love.**

**Instead, *grow* love.** Not only to make her love you but also to allow *you* to love her. Know who you are and know who (s)he is. Try to fill in the gaps of each other. Be strong when (s)he's weak, but also share your weakness&mdash;because (s)he needs to know that too. **And when you find that compatibility, *that's* love.**
