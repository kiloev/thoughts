> I'm sure this is oversharing.

My mother has been a figure of power in my family. She's the one who defines the rules and plans the activities in our household. She is the lioness in our home, you might say. Naturally, growing up, I wasn't very pleased with all the control she exerted to us—the children. I felt that she was not reasonable at times, rarely able to discuss things clearheadedly. She also tends to overshadow us by being in the front line of interactions and conflicts with the outside world.

Years ago, a few months into living apart from my parents, I started to look at things differently. First of all, I was very grateful to finally live outside the cover of her wings. I was learning to take care of myself. It was definitely outside of my comfort zone because even simple things like ordering food to waiters were usually done by her (or my father). I was *not* used to speaking up. Second of all, I realized that all the rules and protections were reverse-psychology triggers to me. I was determined that someday, I will lead a life on my own and be strong and decisive just like her—only on my terms. She, unconsciously, gave an example to us.

It doesn't only affect *my* life, though. It also changed my perception of how an ideal woman and partner should be: strong, brisk, independent, unbounded. Honestly, I was perplexed to see how some of the women I met later in life are used to follow the path that's defined *for* them. How they are like storybook village girl who has no power over their *own* life. It's very different from the woman I'm used to in my life, haha.

All in all, her influence in my life has been enormous. Some are good things that are lead by example. Some others, I treat them as mental improvement notes for me when I grow up older. One thing for sure, she gave up her dreams to raise us, so she must love us very much, and people have different ways to show love. Well, of course I love her too. But don't tell her, it's awkward.
