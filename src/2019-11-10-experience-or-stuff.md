> Do you need your candles lit? I might be able to help.

Instead of an experience-person, I'm more of a stuff-person. I'm easily tempted to buy nice stuff; sometimes things I don't need but which ownership seems to bring joy—*not* to brag or feel belong in society. Truth time: my latest random desire for stuff ownership is ... Zippo lighters. I mean, I don't even smoke! What do I do with it anyway? Light a candle?

Now, I have a question. How do people justify "buying" experience? When you're buying stuff, you're getting something tangible and measurable. You can compare their specs and reviews, or even calculate their potential depreciation cost to judge whether the purchase is logical—which I sometimes do. You have clearer expectations of how they look, how they function, how they enhance your life, and how they compare to other alternatives (including not buying anything at all). Experience, however, is *way* more abstract.

For some background, I was lucky enough to grow up with diverse experiences. I studied in 5 schools during my 6 years of elementary school because my dad moved around a lot during his early career. I also moved away from my family at the age of 15 to study in a different city. So yeah, I spent quite some time adapting to new cities, friends, cultures, and habits. Plus, I also had some experience of traveling abroad with my family. After all that, I think I'm qualified to say that I understand the thrill and joy of experiencing something new. What's my problem, then? Honestly, I just realized when writing this.

**When you're investing in experience, the risk is higher**. Your two-weeks high-end vacation might be less memorable than your one-night getaway trip. The expensive music concert you attended could be less enjoyable than the free live music you enjoyed with your friends. The play that you watched across town might be less refreshing than the short movie you watched on YouTube. Things are wildly subjective and inconsistent, without direct proportion to the investment that we're required to make. Well, I am *not* famous for my risk-taking tendency.

(But I'm trying to balance it up.)
