# Hi, Earth!

> After a long search for a writing platform, I settled for [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=a151c76084b5441da81f7cd01096149a).

I've been interested in writing for a long time. I've had several blogs over the years, but none has shone with any useful posts or even strong directions. They were just vent-holes for my thoughts and this ... doesn't seem to be different. Well, that's OK.

Writing is a form of therapy, for me. It teaches you how to shape your thoughts—from randomly connected dots into something that *speaks*. You've got to agree that textual communication is very important, these days, right? It also teaches you how to be expressive with words. The flow of words isn't just letters; they have meaning, they tell stories, and they convey beauty.

That's why I've been wanting to write again. To have a voice amidst the noise. And to practice. Because I believe **every art form needs practice, and writing is no different**. This time, I wanted a more simplistic approach to writing. I just wanted a space to write. I didn't want to be distracted by the ability to skin or meddle with the design too much—I get easily distracted and soon, exhausted when I'm styling a blog. I also didn't want to do too much technical set up, if I were to set it up myself from scratch. I just wanted to practice writing.

In the end, I found [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=a151c76084b5441da81f7cd01096149a); it's a note-taking app with superpowers. It supports writing in Markdown, tables, task boards, bookmarks, and many other cool features. And when I found out that it allows us to share notes publicly, I was excited and decided to give it a try because it might answer multiple needs altogether. Therefore, here I am right now, writing this to greet you: **"Hi, Earth!"**
